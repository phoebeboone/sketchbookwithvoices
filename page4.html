    They say your walls should look no different than your work,
    but that is only a feeble prediction of the future. We know the
    ego is the true maker of history, and if it isn't, it should be no
    concern of yours.

        Let me first announce a very modest frame of mind. I've got
        the declamatory stance, moving my hand...

        I saw somebody. It was two days ago. That was on First
        Avenue. A phone booth. Then this... Talking to somebody
        in a phone booth and he was looking straight and he was
        gesturing. That's not unusual. It struck me because I'd seen
        a couple of other things...

        I'd seen these pigeons and they were bathing... you know,
        a sylvan romantic scene, bathing birds and bathing
        nymphs... but it was slop! Thinned-out garbage that they
        were bathing in with enthusiasm!

        Then this private phone conversation excluding everything
        except the person in the telephone booth but which
        established the person he was talking to like a hologram
        that no one else sees.

        So I look up and see a helicopter. It was the day after
        <span class="italic">A-Team </span> If I see a helicopter, that clicks on television. It's
        an association that was new to me as something I could
        recognize as a connection, not a metaphor but what it's
        made out of...

        OK, the helicopter is concentrated. It's small. It's got a
        certain figure like a letter. It means something. So it means
        <span class="italic">television. </span>

        Three trifles stacked up together that stuck in my mind.
