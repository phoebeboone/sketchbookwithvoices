                                        The first thing that has to be broken down is your relationship
                                        to authority. Your insecurity could possibly be the wedge
                                        that opens up your perspective on what you think is possible
                                        for you to do.

                  The reason for working has to come from <span class="italic"> you </span>, from <span class="italic"> your </span>
                  psyche, <span class="italic"> your </span> will, <span class="italic"> your </span> ambition. The motivation has to be a
                  personal one. You cannot be derivative. You cannot go
                  bellow that.

                  What I want to be is proud of you, even if you are no good.
