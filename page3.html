      There are five major ideas dealing with flat design. First, all
      spaces are dealt with equally on the surface. Second, there
      is existential space, or Buddhist space, which is indeter-
      minate, indefinite space. It's the space of the Universe, the
      Void, and everything is placed in it. Third, then, there is the
      opposite: constructed, measuring space, as in Renaissance
      perspective. The fourth is the idea of light as the primary
      statement of form.

      The fifth way of working is expressionistically, which may or
      may not take into account everything.
